## Overview

CliPE pegRNA designer is a tool designed to facilitate the construction of pegRNA sequences for targeted prime editing screens. This tool simplifies the process of designing pegRNAs by automating the sequence generation and validation steps.

## Features

- Automated prioritization of editing regions based on Clinvar and GnomAD data
- Automated pegRNA sequence generation
- Sequence validation and error checking

## Usage

CliPE pegRNA designer is available for use at [design.clipe-mave.org](https://design.clipe-mave.org). Additional information on usage can be found on the CliPE homepage [here](https://home.clipe-mave.org) or in the manuscript [here](https://star-protocols.cell.com/protocols/4231).
